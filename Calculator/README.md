# Glass Calculator

A single-page, glassmorphism-inspired calculator UI contained entirely within `index.html`. The app combines modern translucent styling with fully functional calculator logic, including keyboard support.

## Features
- **Glassmorphism styling:** Gradients, blurred panels, and glowing accents create a frosted glass appearance with responsive tweaks for small screens.
- **Interactive display:** Shows calculation history and current value, formatting numbers with thousands separators.
- **Calculator operations:** Supports number entry, decimal handling, clear/all-clear, sign inversion, percent, binary operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide), chained operations, and division-by-zero protection.
- **Keyboard-friendly:** Buttons are wired to keyboard events such as Enter/`=` for evaluation and Escape for clearing.

## File overview
- `index.html` — Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the calculator UI and behavior.

Open the HTML file directly in a browser to use the calculator.
