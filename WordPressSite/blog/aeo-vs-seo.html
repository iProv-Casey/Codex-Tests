      <p class="intro">SEO is about helping search engines understand and rank your content. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) focuses on structuring content so AI assistants and featured snippets can deliver concise, trustworthy answers. For modern WordPress sites, you need both.</p>

      <h2>Where they overlap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Intent-matched content:</span> Both reward content that aligns with the user’s question and demonstrates expertise.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Structured pages:</span> Clean headings, logical sections, and descriptive alt text make it easier for crawlers and LLMs to parse.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Technical quality:</span> Fast performance, HTTPS, and mobile-friendly layouts boost visibility in search and assistant answers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where they differ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Format:</span> SEO can lean on long-form depth, while AEO favors concise answers and scannable checklists that models can quote.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Schema:</span> SEO benefits from organization-wide markup; AEO leans heavily on FAQ, HowTo, and Product schema blocks.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">SERP real estate:</span> SEO pursues rankings across ten blue links; AEO targets featured snippets, People Also Ask boxes, and AI overview callouts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to optimize a WordPress site for both</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="highlight">Lead with a concise answer:</span> Open each page with a two-to-three sentence summary that can serve as an instant response.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Use semantic headings:</span> Structure H2/H3 blocks around the questions people ask. It improves crawlability and makes content easier to quote.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Add schema blocks:</span> Implement FAQ and HowTo blocks using WordPress plugins or custom ACF fields to emit valid JSON-LD.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Polish performance:</span> Compress images, lazy-load media, and cache pages so assistants trust your site as a fast, reliable source.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Maintain author credibility:</span> Display author bios, publication dates, and sources to signal experience and trustworthiness.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
      <p>SEO and AEO are complementary. Build authoritative, well-structured content, then use schema and performance best practices to make your WordPress site the easiest option for both search engines and answer engines to feature.</p>
